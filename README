This project includes a core module which evaluates three input strings as lines in a possible haiku poem. 
The evaluation means giving the candidate a score based on a few criteria, mostly regarding technical style
instead of imagery.

There is also a small, stripped down java swing frontend to try it out.

Project goal is set at porting it to Android and iOS.
